# Software Engineering Immersive: Project 1

This is my very first project built while at General Assembley as a Software Engineering Immersive Student.


# Dream Catcher 

Created a game inspired by the original snake game allowing the player to catch their dreams. Incorporated game rules and animation.

# Brief 

* Allowed game to render in a browswer. 
* Included HTML and JS as seperate files. 
* Kept it Simple Stupid. 
* Delpoyed the game online. 


## Tech Stack 

Built with:

* CSS3
* Git and Github
* JS ES6
* HTML5

## Release History

* Will not be updating this app. I wanted to show the challenges that I came across building it in the one week timeframe given. This is also being used as a benchmark to show where I started to where I am today. This app was made on Jan. 10th, 2020. 


## Deployment

This game is deployed via GitHub Pages and can be found here - [Dream Catcher](https://justteaco.github.io/dream-catcher/)



# How To Start 

You can fork and clone this game! Once forked/cloned to your repository, open the index.html file in the browser and the game loads. Feel free to replace images and customise to your liking. 

# Built Game 
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.Dream Catcher is built for a single player. The game is inspired by the tradtional snake game so you have to navigate through the grid to catch your dreams. The more you catch, the more you manifest. 


I designed a landing page to display the instructions of the game and kept it super simple and minimal.

The start screen displays the yogi in a signle square that is placed randomly on the grid. The Dream is also at random and generated upon each new game played.

The more your manifest, the faster you have to catch your dreams. The object of the game is to not allow the dreams to hit the wall. If it does, you can play again and manifest more.

To navigate through the game, the player can press the left, right, up, down arrow keys to catch dreams. This game can not be paused and only disrupted when the yogi hits the wall or runs into itself.

# Planning and Development 
## Planning 

Planning the Dream Catcher game took a day and a half for me to brainstorm what I wanted it to look and feel like. I applied the techniques,lessons, and practices taught the first two weeks of the course at GA to create it. I used CSS, HTML, Dom manipluation, and array methods. 

## Development 

* The Grid:

This generates an array which contains the total index length equal to the height times the width. 

* The Yogi:
* The Yogi Movement: 
* The Dream: 

# Project Managment

Day 1: brainstorming the look and plan of the game. 

Days 2-5: developed the game fucntions and a little bit of styling. 

Days 5-7: styled and presented my project to the class

# Successes

I was able to thoroughly able to understand and implement the methods used on a JS data. I learned how to use if statements and for loops which makes the yogi collide in its self. I learned how to use DOM manipulation techniquesso the game renders. Lastly, it taught me discipline. I was able to work in a short time frame, figure out my errors, and plan a project. 

# Challenges and Improvements
## Challenges:


* My biggest challange was making sure the yogi gained speed once it catched it's dream. I used event listeners to maniplaute the arrow keys, which then controls the movement of the yogi. It got tricky when I had to make sure the yogi not reverese into its self.

* Making sure the head of the yogi was detacted on collision.
I overcame this challange by slicing the yogi's array. Then I was able to detect the square which containted the other index's of the array when the yogi head was in the same grid square.

# Improvements 

I plan to advance and improve this game by:

* Fix the broken image that generates the amount of dreams catched. 
* Making the grid bigger. 
* Apply a countdown and highest scrore. 
* Making the game mobile responsive.
