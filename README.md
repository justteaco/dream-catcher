## Tech Stack 

Built with:

* CSS3
* Git and Github
* JS ES6
* HTML5

## Release History

* Will not be updating this app. I wanted to show the challenges that I came across building it in the timeframe give. 


## Deployment

This game is deployed via GitHub Pages and can be found here - [Dream Catcher](https://justteaco.github.io/dream-catcher/)





# How To Start 

You can fork and clone this game! Once forked/cloned to your repository, open the index.html file in the browser and the game loads. Feel free to replace images and customise to your liking. 

# Built Game 
Dream Catcher is built for a single player. The game is inspired by the tradtional snake game so you have to navigate through the grid to catch your dreams. The more you catch, the more you manifest.

The more your manifest, the faster you have to catch your dreams. The object of the game is to not allow the dreams to hit the wall. If it does, you can play again and manifest more.

To naivagate through the grid, the player can press the left, right, up, down arrow keys to catch dreams. 


# Challenges and Improvements
## Challenges:


* My biggest challange was making sure the yogi gained speed once it catched it's dream. I used event listeners to maniplaute the arrow keys, which then controls the movement of the yogi. It got tricky when I had to make sure the yogi not reverese into its self. 

* Making sure the head of the yogi was detacted on collision.
I overcame this challange by slicing the yogi's array. Then I was able to detect the square which containted the other index's of the array when the yogi head was in the same grid square.

* Making the game mobile responsive.
